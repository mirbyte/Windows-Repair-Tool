## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Always backup important data** before running system repairs
- **Requires administrator privileges** to execute repairs
- **System restart is recommended** after running sequential repairs, regardless of individual command results
- Windows Update repairs may temporarily disable update services
- Internet connection required for downloading system files during repair
- The sequential repair mode follows Microsoft's recommended execution order for optimal results

## 🔧 Technical Details

The script performs the following technical operations:

### Core Repair Commands (Sequential Mode)
- **DISM ScanHealth**: Detects Windows image corruption
- **DISM RestoreHealth**: Repairs Windows component store using Windows Update
- **SFC scannow**: Verifies and repairs individual system files

### Windows Update Repair Operations
- Service management (stop/start) for:
  - Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)
  - Windows Update Service
  - MSI Installer
  - Cryptographic Services
  - Application Identity Service
- Registry component re-registration
- Network stack reset
- Driver state management
- Windows component cleanup

## 📋 Command Execution Order

The sequential repair mode follows Microsoft's recommended order:

1. **DISM /ScanHealth** - Identifies corruption in the Windows image
2. **DISM /RestoreHealth** - Repairs the Windows component store 
3. **sfc /scannow** - Repairs individual system files using the clean component store

This hierarchical approach ensures each tool can function optimally and repairs proceed from the foundational Windows image level down to individual system files.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you're running as administrator
2. Check internet connectivity for file downloads
3. Verify Windows Update service is accessible
4. Check system drive for sufficient space (at least 2GB free recommended)
5. Review logs in `%windir%\Logs\DISM\dism.log`
6. If sequential repairs don't resolve issues, try running individual commands separately
7. For persistent corruption, consider Windows in-place upgrade or system restore
